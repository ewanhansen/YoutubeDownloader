# YouTube Dowloader
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)

Youtube Downloader is a lightweight, YouTube video downloader that supports .mp3 and .mp4 file formats. The downloader employs customtkinter for a more modern UI look and pytube for it's downloading, filtering and searching capabilities.

## Features

- Extremely simple to operate
- Paste video link
- Choose between .mp3 and .mp4
- Click download button and choose destination

NOTE: It is against YouTube's terms of service to download content without express permission from YouTube themselves. This tool is meant merely as a demonstration and for portfolio purposes. Any legal troubles or mishaps are not the responsibility of myself or any contributors to YouTube Downloader.

> The video quality is only 720p. As of writing,
> I can not find a way to make it higher than that.
> Welcome to any collaborations that have a solution
> for allowing pytube to pull higher quality video.

## Installation

Just go under the Releases tab to download the executuable! Or you can just steal the .py file.

## Development

Small quality of life improvements are being made to the application to make it more robust and bulletproof. Check back every once and a while for an updated version.
